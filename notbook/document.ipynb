It is useful to have one encompassing definition \\nthat is extensible as well as expressive, building on commonly understood concepts \\nfrom the past. For us, we refer to a few basic principles that embody an agent, and \\nwe use them to develop the notion of an “agent object” in the world of LLMs and \\nVLMs. We’ve distilled the following primary concepts that need to be embodied by an \\nagent object in order for them to be programmed scalably to build robust systems.\\n3. Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) \\nA common model used in agent-oriented programming (AOP) is the BDI model, \\nwhere agents are characterized by their beliefs (information about the world), \\ndesires (goals or objectives), and intentions (plans of action). \\nExample: The chatbot believes the user is seeking customer support, desires to \\nprovide the best assistance, and executes a plan to guide the user through relevant \\ntroubleshooting steps.\\n1. Autonomy \\nAn agent is an autonomous, interactive, goal-driven entity with its own state, \\nbehavior, and decision-making capabilities. It has the capability of \\nself-improvement when it sees that it is unable to meet the performance \\nparameters for reaching its goal. \\nExample: An Agentic Chatbot adapts its conversational tone and logic based on \\nuser feedback, refining responses to better align with the user's intent over time.\\n2. Reactivity and Proactivity \\nAgents can be both reactive, meaning they can sense their environment and \\nrespond to changes by taking actions, and proactive, meaning they can take \\ninitiative based on their goals. Agents can take actions that change the state of \\ntheir environment, which can ensure their progress toward their goal. \\nExample: The chatbot detects frustration in a user’s tone (reactivity) and proactively \\noffers a detailed guide or direct solution without waiting for further input.\\n15\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Ebook-Agentic-AI.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='4. Social Ability & Communication \\nAgents have a communication mechanism and can interact with other agents or \\nentities in their environment. This interaction can be highly complex, as it may \\ninvolve negotiation, coordination, and cooperation. With the advent of LLMs, this \\ncommunication can be completely based on natural language, which is both \\nhuman - and machine - understandable. \\nExample: The chatbot interacts with a scheduling system to book appointments \\nand communicates the details in clear, natural language to the user.\\n 6. Memory \\nAn agent needs to have long-term memory (LTM) of its past interactions and \\nsuccessful past means of completing its task. LTM can help to greatly reduce the \\namount of computing that an agent must perform to complete a new task by \\nreferencing relevant past plans and actions. The memory is also the place where an \\nagent can store human demonstrations it has seen, which can expedite its \\nprogress without as rigorous a planning and reasoning loop. An agent also has \\nshort-term memory, which is typically its current context signified by prompts and \\nany information available in its context length. \\nExample: The chatbot recalls previous user preferences (LTM) to suggest relevant \\nsolutions and uses the current conversation’s context (STM) to address immediate \\nconcerns effectively. \\n 5. Constitution \\nAn agent needs to adhere to some regulations and policies depending on the \\nimperatives of its task and goals. It needs to protect itself from being \\ncompromised or destroyed as well as be trusted not to harm other agents sharing \\nthe environment in which it is operating. \\nExample: The chatbot complies with privacy regulations by anonymizing sensitive \\nuser data and ensures that it avoids generating harmful or biased responses. \\n16\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES'),\n",

Such architectures benefit from a single agent's ability \\nto operate without the risk of interference from other agents' feedback, which can be \\ndistracting. However, they may hit execution loops if their reasoning capabilities \\naren't robust.\\nIn contrast, MAS shines in tasks requiring diverse feedback and parallel task \\nexecution. These systems can leverage feedback from other agents to verify their \\nwork and improve task outcomes. \\nIn terms of asynchronous task execution, single-agent systems can conduct multiple \\nsimultaneous calls, but they lack inherent parallel execution capabilities, making them \\nslower in sequential planning and task execution. Multi-agent systems allow \\nindependent agent operation, facilitating dynamic task allocation and parallel \\nprocessing across multiple sub-goals derived from an overall goal. \\nIn all this, the role of human feedback is very important. Implementing iterative \\nfeedback mechanisms helps agents refine their solutions, correcting courses to \\nreach the desired goals more effectively. Human oversight further aligns agent \\nresponses with human expectations, thus reducing inefficient or invalid outputs for \\nhigh-risk tasks. \\nAgentic systems are also emerging that maintain overarching goals, and can sense \\nand react to their environments, and adjust their actions to progress toward these \\ngoals.

The planning \\nprocess begins with understanding the overarching objectives and identifying the \\ntasks required to achieve them. Each task is then decomposed into smaller, \\nmanageable sub-tasks, which can be allocated to agents based on their capabilities, \\navailability, and current workload. \\n  \\nSophisticated algorithms often support this distribution process, considering agent \\nstrengths, task dependencies, and completion deadlines. This ensures tasks are \\nassigned to the most suitable agents, optimizing the system's collective intelligence \\nand performance. By executing tasks in parallel across multiple agents - when \\nproperly planned and broken down - the system enhances efficiency, reduces \\nbottlenecks, and accelerates project completion times. \\nVerification of the Task Done by Different Agents: \\nVerifying the outputs of tasks performed by different agents is vital to maintaining \\nsystem reliability and quality assurance within a multi-agent system. This verification \\nprocess involves cross-checking task completion against predefined success criteria \\nor performance metrics, ensuring that the outputs align with the expected results. \\n  \\nDepending on the system's complexity, verification can be automated using built-in \\nevaluators or require human oversight in ambiguous scenarios.

In \\ncontrast, parallel execution allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously, making it ideal \\nfor independent or loosely coupled tasks that can be executed concurrently.
